ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Curtis Friesen (@curtisfreezin)

Iâ€™m a software developer interested in new technologies and large data projects. I am also a graphic and web designer, focused on comfortable and intuitive user experiences.

Iâ€™m actively engaging in small Python projects to improve my functional programming mindset while continuing with C#, SQL, HTML and Typescript (Ember) for my day-to-day work.

You can view my past projects at https://curtisfriesen.ca/ and you can reach me at thecurtisfriesen@gmail.com if you have a sweet project in mind that you need a designer for or would like collaboration on.
